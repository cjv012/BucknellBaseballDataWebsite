# BucknellBaseballDataWebsite
Created by Connor Vucovich in order to allow Bucknell Baseball Coach Scott Heather to upload .csv files outputted by the team's trackman machine to a central database. The website then allows the coaches to select a player from the team and have their metrics displayed to allow the coaches to make better adjustments and have a better understanding of how a given player is performing
The website is build in django and requires the download of django, python, and pyplot
The end goal is to migrate the database to an AWS Postgre database and host the website there are well for the coaches and players use
This is the creator's first attempt at web development and django was chosen becase of the creator's extensive experience in python development and its integrated fullstack framework. 
The end goal of this project is to eventually hand it off to future Bucknell Baseball computer science majors to maintain and build upon for the team's benefit
